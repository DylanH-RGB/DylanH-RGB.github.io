I am an electrical engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduting year 2026/2027.

* Lab 6,
For me this lab was by far my favorite as we learned to code blackjack. Although it was
that I already knew how to play it was fun trying to figure out how to code. Blackjack game 
is a very interesting concept when trying to code and this lab was overall my favorite.

* Lab 8,
I enjoyed doing this lab as we had to try and find the average of the judges score. Trying to find the calculation of the max and min score and baseing the answer from the judges.  This lab was not too challenging but also not too easy so overall I enjoyed.

* Lab 12,
This lab was somethong that I also enjoyed because we are creating an image/gifs. Seeing this we are able to create certain colors with RGB which is very common and can be seen everywhere online.
